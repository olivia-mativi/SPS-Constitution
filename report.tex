\section{Preamble}
We the students of the Physics and Astronomy program of the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, in order to better understand the workings of the universe as a whole, as well as the interactions of science in the everyday life, hereby establish the following constitution. 

\section{Article I (Association)}
The name of this organization will be the Society of Physics Students (SPS). The purpose of the SPS includes providing its members with a more comprehensive understanding of the natural phenomenon of physics as well as the application of physics both inside and outside of the classroom. It will also serve as a means to bring together all students interested in physics through periodic meetings, academic lectures, experiments, field trips and related events. 

\section{Article II (Membership)}
Membership in the SPS will be open to all students of the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh who are interested in physics and are willing to participate in the affairs of the organization. Election of executive Board Members of the organization and changes to the constitution will be determined by a majority vote. Voting rights can be exercised by students in good standing, which consists of regular participation for at least one semester with the organization. Questions concerning the good standing of a member of the organization shall be addressed to the Executive Board and shall be resolved by a majority vote of the present members of the Executive Board. The membership shall determine the direction of the organization in cooperation with the Executive Board and shall decide on all matters delegated to it by the Executive Board. 

\section{Article III (Elections)}
Elections shall be held the last month of the Spring Semester every year. Absentee ballots will be accepted during voting and only members in good standing that are planning to enroll in the Fall Semester of classes at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, may run for office. \\

Nominations for each office will be opened and closed at the beginning of the election process for that office. The voting process shall begin with the office of the President and will continue by filling the offices of Treasurer, Secretary, and  optionally, Oshkosh Student Assembly Representative, in that order. Once the voting procedure has been initiated, only members present for the candidates presentations will be allowed to vote until that office is filled. If more than two candidates run for an office, a vote shall be taken and the top two candidates from that vote shall participate in a run-off vote. In the case of a tie, a second vote will be taken. If the vote remains a tie, the candidatesâ€™ names will be written on a slip of paper and chosen at random. The candidate whose name is picked will fill the position. \\

Votes shall be by secret ballot and tabulated by a third party. 

\section{Article IV (Executive Board)}
The executive board will be composed of four officers including the President, Secretary, Treasurer, and optionally an OSA representative. These officials will be elected by a majority vote of the membership as described in Article III of this constitution. These officers shall bear the responsibility of guiding this organization.\\

The duties of each elected official shall include the following:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item President
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To oversee all the organizational activities,
        \item To serve as the official representative of the organization,

    \end{itemize}
    \item Treasurer

\end{enumerate}

In the event that an elected officer fails to adequately carry out the duties of his/her office, that officer may be impeached by two members of the executive board and a two-thirds majority vote of the members in good standing. In the event of a vacant office, the Executive Board will select a replacement from the members in good standing who shall serve as an interim officer until a general election can occur in accordance with Article III. 

\section{Article V (Amendments)}
Amendments may be made to the constitution of the SPS with a two-thirds majority vote of the members in good standing and the approval of three members of the Executive Board. An Amendment may not be proposed more than once during a semester.
